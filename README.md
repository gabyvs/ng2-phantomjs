Angular 2 RC5 Tests
===================

Simple component with simple test that run successfully on Chrome but fail on PhantomJS.

## Install all dependencies
Run `npm install`.

## Running tests

Run `npm run test:chrome` to run all the tests against Chrome browser.
Run `npm run test:phantom` to run all the tests against PhantomJS headless browser.

Ideally, both modes should be successful.
